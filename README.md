# WAR-Cards-Game
This project is a Python implementation of the classic card game "War". The game features two players who compete to collect all the cards in the deck. Each round, both players reveal their top card, and the player with the higher card value wins both cards. In the event of a tie, a "war" is triggered where additional cards are drawn to determine the winner. The game continues until one player runs out of cards.

#Features
